# Rule Registry

Every rule this framework holds, with an ID, the layer it *should* live in, and
what enforces it **today**. A rule being unenforced is a tracked state, not a gap
in the documentation.

## Why this file exists

The failure it prevents: a rule is written down, everyone agrees it is correct,
nobody notices it is only prose, and it never fires. Documenting a rule and
enforcing a rule are two different acts. This registry keeps the difference
visible.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `HOOK` | A hook exits 2. Cannot be ignored. |
| `TEST` | A test fails the build. Cannot be ignored. |
| `GATE` | A CI job fails on it. Cannot be ignored. |
| `AGENT` | An audit agent reports it. Advisory — a human must act. |
| `LINT` | The linter or type checker catches it. |
| `PROSE` | Written down only. **Will eventually be ignored.** |
| `JUDGMENT` | Correctly prose — mechanising it would produce false positives. |

`PROSE` on a mechanisable rule is a **known debt**, and every one carries a
promote-when trigger. `JUDGMENT` is a finished state.

Works on one instance, fails intermittently on two. Structurally invisible
because every environment before production is single-instance.

## Reading this file

- **IDs are permanent once issued (A9).** Never renumber, split, or reuse an ID — project manifests reference them forever. Superseding a rule takes a **new** ID plus a `Superseded by <new-ID>` note in the old row. `render_registry.py --validate` and `upgrade.py` fail on any reference to an ID that no longer exists.
- **Projects do not copy this file (A2).** A project holds `.claude/rules/manifest.json` (`{"rules": [...], "overrides": {...}}`) and renders its view on demand with `scripts/render_registry.py`. A committed `REGISTRY.md` in a project is stale by definition.
- **`PROSE` on a mechanisable rule is debt.** The promote-when column is its ticket.
- Several rules are `PROSE` because they only apply to some projects. `M-02` matters when the project moves money and is noise otherwise. Those promote at project setup, not globally — `/project-init` turns them on with the module.
- **`JUDGMENT` is finished.** Do not try to mechanize it; you will get false positives and people will disable the check.
- `/retro` updates this file. A rule that was violated gets its status re-examined before anyone restates it.
