# Enforcement

The organizing principle of this framework, and the one it most easily violates.

## Three layers, differing in whether they can be ignored

| Layer | Enforced by | Ignorable? |
|---|---|---|
| **Hooks** (plugin-declared `hooks/hooks.json`, plus `.claude/settings.json` for the local fallback) | The harness, before/after tool calls | **No** — it executes |
| **Tests** (verify, CI) | The test runner | **No** — it fails the build |
| **Skills** | Fire on task shape | Only by not invoking them |
| **Instruction files** (CLAUDE.md, rules) | Being read | **Yes — demonstrably** |

Anything load-bearing should be a hook or a test. Instruction files carry
reference and judgment, not enforcement.

**Why most hooks are not in this repo's own `.claude/settings.json` (A18).**
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — needed to point a hook command at code that lives in
the plugin — only resolves inside the plugin's *own* `hooks/hooks.json`. Built
into a project's own `settings.json` instead, it silently fails: the hook is
skipped, not run with an empty value (measured on Claude Code 2.1.220). So this
project's guard, rule-zero, done-check, format, verify-record, and
session-context hooks are declared once, globally, by the plugin — which means
they match on *every* repo you have Claude Code open in, not only this one.
Each checks `.claude/.framework-state.json` before doing anything else and
no-ops instantly if it is absent, which is how a repo that never adopted this
framework pays nothing for a plugin it may not even have installed. The one
hook still wired directly in this repo's `settings.json` is
`.claude/hooks/guard-local.sh` — copied in at scaffold time specifically so a
relative path works, and specifically so C-01/C-02 still block if the plugin
itself is ever uninstalled.

## The load path

*(Corrected twice on 2026-08-11 — first the subdirectory claim, then the rules
claim, both against live evidence and the Claude Code memory docs. Recording
both corrections because each earlier version taught a live audit a false
finding.)*

What current Claude Code auto-loads, per its memory documentation:

- `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md` — **upward walk** from the session's working
  directory; a root file reaches a session started in `dist/` or `packages/x/`.
- `.claude/rules/*.md` — discovered **recursively and loaded at launch** when
  unscoped ("the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`"); rules with `paths:`
  frontmatter load on demand when matching files are read. Symlinked rules
  resolve normally.

What does **not** auto-load: `AGENTS.md`-style guides. The documented fix is a
`CLAUDE.md` that imports it (`@AGENTS.md`) or a symlink — not a hook.

**Where that leaves `hooks/session-context.sh`:** A15 decided 2026-08-11,
with evidence — on Claude Code 2.1.220 a sentinel rule in `.claude/rules/`
loaded headlessly with no hook and no `settings.json`. The hook is re-scoped:
its **primary job is session telemetry** (`.claude/.session-log`, the evidence
layer for `session_report.py`, `/retro`, `/promote-rule`); the rules-index
injection is redundant defense-in-depth kept for older CLIs and
`--setting-sources` exclusions. Do not cite it as
the reason rules are in context, and verify actual loading with `/context`
rather than inference. "The agent stopped reading the rules file" can still be
a configuration defect — but establish it with evidence, not doctrine.

Corollary: **never diagnose a repeated instruction failure as inattention until
you have confirmed the instruction was actually in context.** Check the load path
first.

## Hook precedence (A6 — evidence-backed)

When multiple hooks match one tool call — two `PreToolUse` entries on `Write`,
or plugin hooks alongside a project's own — the contract is:

- **All matching hooks run — observed directly via per-hook markers, both
  orders — and any hook exiting 2 blocks the call.** A passing hook cannot
  override a blocking one, and a blocking hook does not prevent later hooks
  from running (so side-effectful hooks still fire on blocked calls — design
  them accordingly).
- **Order affects only which message the user sees first, never correctness.**
  Proven both ways on CLI 2.1.220 with a validity control
  (`docs/acceptance/2026-08-11-a6-hook-precedence.md`).
- Plugin and project hook arrays **merge** (per the settings documentation);
  writing a project hook never disables a plugin hook on the same matcher.

Design consequence: hooks must be independent — never write a hook that
assumes another hook ran before it, and never rely on ordering to suppress a
block.

## Honest audit of this framework

Most of what f4d-kit ships is prose, and prose is the ignorable layer. Where each
rules module actually sits:

| Module | Mechanically enforceable | Currently enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| `keysafety` | Yes | **hook** — `guard.sh`, exit 2 |
| `core` (no force-push, no destructive SQL) | Yes | **hook** — `guard.sh` |
| Canonical home / no duplicate variants | Yes | **hook** — `rule-zero.sh` |
| Done-without-verify | Yes | **hook** — `done-check.sh` |
| `database` (FK indexes, unsafe migrations) | Yes | `schema-reviewer` agent — advisory, should become a test |
| `data-integration` (timeouts, retries, fixtures) | Yes | `integration-auditor` agent — advisory, should become a test |
| `contracts` (drift) | Yes | `contract-drift-checker` agent + CI gate |
| `silent-degradation` (empty-collection, raw ids) | **Yes — and not yet enforced** | prose. Highest-value gap. |
| `capability-parity` (consumer enumeration, parity) | **Partly — and not yet enforced** | prose |
| `money` (splits sum, no float) | Yes | prose — should be a lint rule + property test |
| `determinism` (golden fixtures) | Yes | prose — should be a committed fixture test |
| `guards` (red-then-green) | Partly | prose + Definition of Done |
| `api`, `python`, `typescript` style | Partly | linter where possible, else prose |
| `livesystem`, `dataprotection`, `observability` | Mostly judgment | prose, correctly |

**The rightmost column is the roadmap.** Every "prose" entry that is mechanically
enforceable is a known gap, not an accepted state.

## Rules that should become tests, in priority order

These are the checks that catch silent degradation — the failure class that
survives review because the output still looks plausible:

1. **Non-empty assertion** — any test iterating a collection asserts it is non-empty first. An empty collection makes every assertion vacuously true.
2. **No raw ids rendered** — a test that fails if an identifier appears in user-visible output.
3. **Consumer enumeration** — changing a shared contract fails CI until every consumer is touched in the same change.
4. **Preview/execute parity** — a dry run and a live run produce the same request set.
5. **Row vs call failure** — one bad row in a batch does not abort the batch.
6. **Unconsumed capability is visible** — a capability with no consumer renders as disabled-with-reason, not as an absent control.
7. **One canonical resolver** — no two modules answer the same question from separate hardcoded lists.

Each needs a **failing-then-passing** test proving the harness works before it is
populated. A scaffold nobody has seen fail is the same defect one level up.

When `/retro` finds a rule that was violated, the first question is not "how do
we restate it" — it is **"which layer should this have been in?"**
