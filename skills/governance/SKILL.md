description: Govern how the design system evolves — SemVer for ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/kit/tokens/components, the contribution workflow, deprecation policy, and change communication. Use when the user wants to add/promote/deprecate a component or token, decide a version bump, set up a contribution process, or keep the system from fragmenting.

# Skill: Governance

Keep the system consistent as it grows. Apply versioning, contribution, and deprecation rules.

## Steps
1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/kit/workflows/governance.md` (SemVer table, contribution workflow, deprecation policy, change comms).
2. Classify the change: **major** (breaking — renamed/removed token or prop, changed anatomy/default), **minor** (additive — new token/component/variant/optional prop), **patch** (fix — contrast/bug/doc/value tweak in tolerance).
3. For a **new** component/token: confirm it serves a real, repeated need (≥ 2 places) before promoting product → candidate → core. Design it to the full quality bar (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/kit/rules/components.md` → Component Quality Bar).
4. For a **deprecation**: mark with reason + replacement + removal version; keep working ≥ 1 minor cycle; provide a migration map (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/kit/design-systems/crosswalk.md` style); remove only in a major.
5. Wire any new file into `CLAUDE.md` (File Reference Map + relevant table/router) and add a changelog entry.

## Verification (definition of done)
- Change has a SemVer level **and** a changelog entry.
- Removals have a deprecation window, a replacement, and a migration table.
- New spec meets the 8-state + a11y + token-mapping bar and is reachable via the router.
- `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/kit/scripts/validate_tokens.py` passes; contrast re-checked if colors changed.
