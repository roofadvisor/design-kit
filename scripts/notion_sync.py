"""
dev-kit — GitHub → Notion work sync.

Runs in GitHub Actions. Pushes engineering state into the company Work DB.
One direction only: GitHub owns state, Notion owns triage.

Never writes triage fields (Class, Size, Priority, Stage, Area, Launch, Notes).
Those belong to the human and are preserved on every update.

Env:
  NOTION_TOKEN     Notion integration token
  NOTION_WORK_DB   data source id of the Work DB
  GITHUB_TOKEN     fetches the real issue when a PR links one Notion has not seen yet
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_EVENT_PATH  provided by Actions

CLI:
  (no args)      Run the sync. Requires every env var above.
  resolve-issue  Print the linked issue number for GITHUB_EVENT_PATH's event
                 (or nothing, if none is linked) and exit 0. Requires only
                 GITHUB_EVENT_PATH — never NOTION_TOKEN/NOTION_WORK_DB/
                 GITHUB_TOKEN. Used by notion-sync.yml's `resolve` job to
                 compute the `sync` job's concurrency-group key before that
                 job (which does need those secrets) starts, so this mode
                 must stay callable without them.
