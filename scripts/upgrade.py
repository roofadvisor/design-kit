A1 — framework upgrade path.

Diffs a project's .claude/ against the plugin's current templates and classifies
every difference. Project customizations must survive; that is what makes this
usable more than once.

  UNCHANGED   identical — nothing to do
  FRAMEWORK   plugin changed, project untouched     → safe to apply
  LOCAL       project customized, plugin unchanged  → keep, never overwrite
  CONFLICT    both changed                          → human decides
  NEW         plugin has a file the project lacks   → offer
  ORPHAN      project has a rule the plugin dropped → flag, do not delete

Default is a dry run. --apply writes only FRAMEWORK and accepted NEW.

# plugin-declared hooks (guard.sh, rule-zero.sh, done-check.sh, format.sh,
# verify-record.sh, session-context.sh) do anything at all.
#
# No migration or backfill was needed for that: every repo /project-init has
# ever taken through step 7 (companions) or step 11 (this module's --apply)
# already has this file, on every version of the kit, including every one
# scaffolded before A18 was fixed. The moment such a repo's plugin installation
# updates past the version that ships hooks/hooks.json, its hooks start firing
# for real — with ZERO changes required in the target repo itself. Presence
# alone is deliberately the whole opt-in signal; hook_opted_in() never parses
# this file's contents (see its own comment for why a malformed-but-present
# file must still count as opted in), so nothing here needs a new field for
# A18 and nothing below needs to change to keep writing it correctly.
